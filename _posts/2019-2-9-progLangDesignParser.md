#### Problem Description
A recognizer is like a souped-up scanner; Like a scanner, it repeatedly calls lex to serve up lexemes. Additionally, it checks each lexeme against a grammar that describes the language in the text being scanned. Ultimately, a recognizer reports whether the entire text is syntactically correct or not.

#### Recognizer Approach
- Recursive descent parsing
- Transforming grammars
- Support functions for recursive descent parsing
- Recognizing expressions
- Conditionals and iterations
